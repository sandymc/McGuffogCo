		<p>WinDat Opener has been the top rated winmail.dat decoder app for compatibility and reliability on the App Store since 2011. WinDat Opener opens the "winmail.dat" email attachments that are sometimes sent by Microsoft email systems. These file are in “TNEF” format, and usually contain attachments such as spreadsheets or presentations embedded within them. WinDat Opener extracts the embedded attachments hidden inside the winmail.dat file, allowing you to preview then right in WinDat Opener, or open them with another app.</p>
		<!-- NOTE. IT'S really important that the last block gets terminated by $ for all rows on a by-resolution
		basis. Otherwise, even if the widths add up to 12, odd things happen.
		So, e.g., if at a reolution you have 4u 4u 4u, it must be 4u 4u 4u$
		at another resolution, 6u 6u must be 6u 6u$

<h2>What are TNEF files?</h2>
<p>Microsoft e-mail programs written for Windows, such as Outlook, sometimes send e-mails in the Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF). Most other e-mail programs, including Apple Mail and Microsoft Entourage, do not understand TNEF. If your e-mail program doesn't understand TNEF, instead of seeing the e-mail and/or attachment, you may only see an attachment named "winmail.dat" or "Part 1.2" that you cannot open. Also, sometimes you may receive a TNEF attachment with a generic name such as ATT00008.dat or ATT00005.eml instead. While almost all attachments named "winmail.dat" are TNEF, you could receive non-TNEF attachments with names ending ".dat" or ".eml", or which are named or labeled "Part 1.2".</p>
<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<p>iOS 11 or later on the iPhone or iPad </p>
