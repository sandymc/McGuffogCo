		<p>dcpTool is a utility for modifying DNG Camera Profiles (.dcp files). Profiles can be compiled and decompiled, as well as transformed to remove "hue twists".</p>
		<!-- NOTE. IT'S really important that the last block gets terminated by $ for all rows on a by-resolution
		basis. Otherwise, even if the widths add up to 12, odd things happen.
		So, e.g., if at a reolution you have 4u 4u 4u, it must be 4u 4u 4u$
		at another resolution, 6u 6u must be 6u 6u$
		-->

					<h3>Compile to and from XML</h3>
					<p>DNG Camera Profiles are binary files that can't be edited; dcpTool can transform profiles in an text based XML form. In XML form, it's easy to modify the profile to customize the profile.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="4u 6u$(small) 12u$(xsmall)">
				<div class="content align-center">
					<h3>Remove "hue twists"</h3>
					<p>Hue twists translate colors "as photographed" into different colors. They can be used to make skies bluer, foliage greener, etc.  But they can result in undesirable color changes when editing images, and can make color matching more difficult. dcpTool allows profiles to be either <a href="https://mcguffogco.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/8000049772-what-are-hue-twists">"untwisted" or made "invariant"</a>.</p>

				<div class="content align-center">
					<h3>Extract profiles from DNG files</h3>
					<p>DNG files can have a camera profile embedded in them. dcpTool allow you to extract the embedded profile as a stand-alone profile.</p>
				</div>

			<div class="4u 6u$(small) 12u$(xsmall)">
				<div class="content align-center">
					<h3>Easy to use</h3>
					<p>Using dcpTool is easy - just select a source folder and a destinations folder, and convert. It's that simple. dcpTool also offers quick, easy batch mode conversions, so you can process as many files as you need to in one operation.</p>

			<div class="4u 6u(small) 12u$(xsmall)">

					<h3>Works with any Raw Developer</h3>
					<p>dcpTool creates industry DNG camera profiles that will work with any app that has support for them, including apps from Adobe.</p>

			<div class="4u$ 6u$(small) 12u4(xsmall)">
				<div class="content align-center">
					<h3>Compatible</h3>
					<p>dcpTool works with any version of OS X all the way back to Yosemite (10.10). And of course, it's fully macOS Big Sur optimized, and comes in a native Apple Silicon version for blazing fast performance on the latest generation Apple Macs.</p>
