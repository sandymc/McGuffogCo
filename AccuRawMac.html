		<p>AccuRaw EXR is a raw image editor and developer that delivers unmatched resolution and control over how your images are processed.  In addition, AccuRaw EXR implements a non-clipping workflow that supports the preservation of "greater than 1" highlights in EXR formats. AccuRaw EXR supports most cameras from major manufacturers; a full list is available on the <a href="https://mcguffogco.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/8000063657-supported-cameras">support site</a>.</p>
		<!-- NOTE. IT'S really important that the last block gets terminated by $ for all rows on a by-resolution
		basis. Otherwise, even if the widths add up to 12, odd things happen.
		So, e.g., if at a reolution you have 4u 4u 4u, it must be 4u 4u 4u$
		at another resolution, 6u 6u must be 6u 6u$

					<h3>Completely linear floating point image processing with True EXR support</h3>
					<p>AccuRaw EXR implements a non-clipping workflow that supports the preservation of "greater than 1" highlights in EXR formats, so that full highlight recovery is available in post. Multiple EXR formats are available - RGB or RGBA, 16- or 32-bit floating point formats.</p>

				<div class="content align-center">
					<h3>Optimized for maximum resolution</h3>
					<p>AccuRaw EXR's demosaicing engine is optimized to deliver maximum resolution from your images - In his testing of an XF lens on a Fuji X-Pro 1, Sean Reid, of Reid Reviews said that "...it seems clear to me that the AccuRaw conversion does the best job of showing us the resolution levels this lens is capable of".</p>

				<div class="content align-center">
					<h3>Precise control over demosiacing</h3>
					<p>Most raw developers give you one choice about how your image is developed - soft images with no risk of artifacts. AccuRaw EXR allows you control over the internal operation of the demosaicing engine. Maximum resolution or maximum suppression of artifacts such as moire, or anywhere in-between. The choice is yours.</p>

			<div class="4u 6u$(small) 12u$(xsmall)">
				<div class="content align-center">
					<h3>Integrates with other other applications such as Lightroom and Aperture</h3>
					<p>AccuRaw EXR will work together with other applications to deliver a smooth, easy workflow that gives you the benefits of AccuRaw EXR's demosaicing and color management within whatever application you're most familiar with. See here for more.</p>

				<div class="content align-center">
					<h3>Accurate, calibrated color workflow</h3>
					<p>Color not the way the remember seeing it? Tired of "content aware processing" and "hue twists" taking decisions away from you? Want your starting point to be what the camera saw, not "enhanced colors"? AccuRaw EXR has a 100% accurate color workflow end to end, and lets you explicitly select whether or not to use tone curves, highlight preservation, etc, etc. And of course, AccuRaw EXR supports industry standard DCP (DNG camera profile) camera calibration files as produced by software from many vendors.</p>

					<h3>macOS High Sierra and Retina/Retina 5K display and Touch Bar compatible</h3>
					<p>AccuRaw EXR is fully compatible with the latest versions of macOS, and the latest hardware from Apple.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>OS X 10.7 (Lion) or later</li>
		<li>4 GB memory minimum, 8GB recommended</li>
		<li>128 MB graphics memory minimum, 512 MB graphics memory recommended</li>
	</ul>
