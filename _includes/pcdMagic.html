			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
		<p>pcdMagic features color profiles that are specific both to model of scanner used, and the original film type used. See the examples above for an example (all other settings at their defaults). pcdMagic can either use its own internal color profiles, or use the original Kodak color profiles as supplied along with Kodak's professional software. And pcdMagic automatically detects which profile to use based on the metadata embedded into the image when it was originally scanned, so you won't need to try to guess which to use.</p>

				<p><i> pcdMagic - clean, correct conversions with full highlight detail preserved.</i></p>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
		<p>pcdMagic correctly translates Kodak’s Photo CD format into modern JPEG images without losing highlight information. The example above shows Ted Felix’s “Blown John” image as converted by pcdtojpeg versus a version that demonstrates the blown highlights problem typical of many other conversion programs.</p>

	</div>
		<p>PCD images use chroma subsampling to minimize file size - what this means is that their are only half as many chroma (color) samples in any image as there are luma (monochrome) samples. This required that when the image was originally scanned, different levels of anti-aliasing had to be applied to the luma and chroma components of the image. As a result, sharpening for a PCD image must be done separately for luma and chroma, and to different degrees. Accordingly, pcdMagic provides PCD optimized sharpening controls. The images below show the differences - for example, look at the differences in detail in the fish net, or in the material on the chair. (Double click the images to see them full sized).</p>

				<p><i>Conventional bi-linear interpolation of a test image, shown at a scale of 4:1. The combination of conventional interpolation and the PCD image's chroma sub-sampling results in a bright purple ghost image.</i></p>

				<p><i>The same image using pcdMagic's adaptive interpolation - no ghost image.</i></p>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
		<p>Conventional interpolation algorithms don't work very well with PCD images - artifacts can easily occur on the edges of objects in the image. pcdMagic has a adaptive algorithm, based on the AHD algorithm used by almost all modern raw developers to decode images from Bayer sensors, but modified to work with PCD images. A test image consisting of light purple squares shows the difference.</p>
		<p>Note that adaptive interpolation is disabled in the trial version of pcdMagic.</p>
