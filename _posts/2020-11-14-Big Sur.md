We've been hard at work, and we're pleased to announce that as of today, all of our products - pcdMagic, AccuRaw EXR, AccuRaw Monochrome, dcpTool, DNG Cleaner, WinDat Opener, etc, are all fully macOS Big Sur optimized. 

Even better, all of the apps now have native Apple Silicon versions bundled into them, so you will have blazing fast speed on the latest generation of Apple Macs.
