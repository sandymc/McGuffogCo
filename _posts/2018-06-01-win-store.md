Good news - pcdMagic for Windows is now available on the Windows store. The Windows store is now our recommended way to purchase pcdMagic for Windows 10 users:
- Free trial available direct from the store
- Automatic updates
- No license code required

For users of versions of Windows prior to Windows 10, you can still purchase a Windows XP/7/8 compatible version of pcdMagic from our FastSpring store.
