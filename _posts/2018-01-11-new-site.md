Our new site is up! Previously, each of our individual products (pcdMagic, AccuRaw, etc) each had their own website. Which was ok back in the day, but has become clunky, and difficult to maintain. So we're migrating to a new, single website. As yet, the migration is only partial - some of the product links on this site just point to old individual sites. But that will change as we complete the migration over the next few weeks.
