There's a new product out!! kxxMagic converts early Kodak digital images - images with .k25 or .kdc extensions - into JPEG, TIFF, EXR or DNG files. kxxMagic builds on the Kodak-specific demosaicing algorithms developed for our award winning pcdMagic software, so conversion is at full resolution with none of the artifacts that other conversion software gives. And, of course, colors are exactly as they were back when the photo was taken.
